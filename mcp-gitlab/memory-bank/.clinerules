# Cline Rules: GitLab MCP Server

## Project Patterns

### Code Style and Structure
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ES6+ syntax and patterns
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Maintain clear error handling with descriptive messages
- Use detailed JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- Keep Git commits focused and descriptive
- Use modular file organization with domain-specific managers
- Implement tool registry pattern for mapping tool names to handlers
- When adding new tools, update the tool registry, tool definitions and documentation

### Documentation and Workflow Patterns
- Use the generate-tools-md.js script to generate TOOLS.md from tools-data.ts
- Git hooks automatically update documentation on commit
- Always run npm run install-hooks after cloning the repository
- When modifying tools-data.ts, the pre-commit hook will update TOOLS.md
- Document all new tools with proper descriptions and parameters
- Organize tools by category in documentation
- Use the npm run install-hooks script to set up git hooks
- Keep README.md and TOOLS.md in sync through automated tooling
- Include both implementation and documentation in the same PR
- For sections with special characters like ampersands, use the correct GitHub-compatible anchor format
  - "User & Group Management" → "#user--group-management" 
  - "Integrations & Webhooks" → "#integrations--webhooks"

### Server Implementation Patterns
- Use `connect` method with the transport for server initialization
- Implement async/await pattern for server startup
- Add proper error handling for server initialization
- Create separate methods for server setup and startup
- Follow MCP SDK patterns for transport configuration
- Add try/catch blocks for async operations to handle errors gracefully

### Tool Definition Patterns
- Create complete tool definitions for all implemented tools in tools-data.ts
- Keep toolDefinitions array and toolRegistry object in sync
- Use consistent schema patterns for similar tools
- Ensure all required parameters are marked as required in the schema
- Categorize tools by domain using array slicing for exports
- Include clear descriptions for tools and their parameters
- Use enum for parameters with specific valid values
- Use proper schema for complex types like pipeline variables
- Document parameter requirements in tool descriptions

### Type Safety Patterns
- Ensure proper type casting for all API parameters
- Validate required parameters before making API calls
- Add explicit validation for required parameters with descriptive error messages
- Use type assertions only when you're certain of the type
- Add interface definitions for complex parameters
- Ensure webhook parameters include required URL field
- Type pipeline variables properly as Record<string, string> | undefined
- Ensure proper types for all exported functions and interfaces

### API Patterns
- All GitLab API calls should use the central axiosInstance
- Properly encode URL parameters for GitLab API paths
- Handle and transform GitLab API responses consistently
- Implement proper error handling for all API calls
- Follow GitLab API v4 conventions for endpoints
- Use domain manager classes to organize related API functionality
- Create reusable utility functions for common API operations

### MCP Protocol Patterns
- Ensure all tool implementations follow MCP protocol specifications
- Return structured error messages for easier troubleshooting
- Format responses according to MCP content types
- Document all tools with clear descriptions and parameter details
- Use the proper method for setting up MCP server transport
- Follow async patterns for server connection and startup
- Ensure all implemented tool handlers have corresponding tool definitions

## Development Workflow
- Use `npm run build` to compile TypeScript code
- Use `npm run install-hooks` to set up git hooks
- Fix any TypeScript compilation errors immediately before proceeding
- Test changes with real GitLab repositories
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes using git hooks
- Consider backward compatibility when modifying existing tools
- Update the progress.md file when implementing new features
- Ensure server initialization and connection works properly before adding new features
- Verify that all implemented tools are properly defined in tools-data.ts

## Implementation Guidelines
- Keep tool implementations modular and focused
- Use the domain manager classes for related functionality
- Reuse API calling patterns where appropriate
- Consider GitLab API rate limits in implementation
- Implement pagination for list operations where needed
- Follow security best practices for handling tokens and sensitive data
- Use consistent error handling patterns across all domain managers
- Use proper TypeScript type casting for parameters to ensure type safety
- Validate all required parameters before making API calls
- Extract common functionality into shared methods within domain managers
- Follow a consistent pattern for handler functions in index.ts
- Use the tool registry pattern for registering and accessing tool handlers
- Maintain synchronization between tool registry and tool definitions

## Documentation Generation
- Use the scripts/generate-tools-md.js script to generate TOOLS.md
- The script parses tools-data.ts to extract tool definitions
- Tool documentation is organized by category
- Each tool includes its name, description, and parameters
- Parameters include name, type, required flag, and description
- Git pre-commit hook automatically updates TOOLS.md when tools-data.ts changes
- The hook is stored in git-hooks/ and can be installed with npm run install-hooks
- Handle special characters in anchor links correctly for GitHub compatibility
- Use hardcoded anchor links for sections with ampersands to ensure correct navigation
- Always run the documentation generator after making changes to tools-data.ts if not using the git hook

## Testing Approach
- Test with both GitLab.com and self-hosted instances
- Verify error cases and edge conditions
- Test with repositories of varying sizes and structures
- Ensure proper handling of non-ASCII characters in responses
- Validate error messages are helpful and descriptive
- Verify proper type checking for all parameters
- Test server initialization and connection with different environments
- Verify proper error handling for failed connections
- Verify all tools are visible to the AI assistant
- Test the documentation generation script with various tool definitions
- Verify the git pre-commit hook correctly updates documentation
- Check that anchor links work correctly in generated documentation

## Documentation Standards
- Maintain clear README with setup instructions
- Document all tools with parameters and return values
- Include usage examples for common operations
- Keep configuration instructions up to date
- Document known limitations and issues
- Document type requirements for tool parameters
- Document server initialization and startup process
- Use TOOLS.md as the single source of truth for tool documentation
- Keep README.md focused on setup, configuration, and general usage
- Include attribution to original projects when extending them
- Use proper licensing information in LICENSE file
- Maintain consistent formatting in documentation
- Use Markdown tables for structured information
- Include table of contents for longer documentation files
- Ensure anchor links work correctly in documentation
- Organize tools by functional category in documentation

## Project Organization
- Keep scripts in the scripts/ directory
- Store git hooks in git-hooks/ directory
- Use src/utils for utility functions
- Organize tool handlers by domain
- Use domain-specific manager classes for related functionality
- Keep tool definitions in a central location (tools-data.ts)
- Maintain memory-bank directory for project documentation
- Group related functions in appropriate files
- Keep the root directory clean and focused on essential files
- Store configuration examples in a dedicated section of README.md
