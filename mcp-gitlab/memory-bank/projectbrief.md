# Project Brief: GitLab MCP Server

## Project Overview
The GitLab MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to interact with GitLab repositories and features. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for repository management, project integrations, CI/CD operations, and user/group administration through a standardized interface.

## Core Requirements
1. Provide a complete set of tools for interacting with GitLab APIs
2. Enable AI assistants to perform GitLab operations through the MCP protocol
3. Support authentication via GitLab API tokens
4. Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
5. Maintain security and privacy of GitLab repositories and data
6. Support both GitLab.com and self-hosted GitLab instances
7. Provide tools for managing project integrations and webhooks
8. Enable CI/CD pipeline configuration and management
9. Support user and group administration

## Goals
- Simplify GitLab interactions for AI assistants
- Improve developer workflow by enabling AI code review and repository management
- Support a comprehensive set of GitLab features through the MCP protocol
- Create a maintainable and extendable codebase
- Document the server functionality clearly for developers and users

## Constraints
- Requires a valid GitLab API token for authentication
- Limited to the operations supported by the GitLab API
- Must comply with GitLab API rate limits and policies
- Must ensure security of sensitive repository data

## Success Criteria
- All listed tools function correctly with the GitLab API
- Error handling provides clear feedback on issues
- Documentation covers installation, configuration, and usage
- The server can be easily configured with different GitLab instances
- Project integrations and webhooks can be managed effectively
- CI/CD pipelines can be configured and triggered
- User and group management operations work correctly
- Type safety is maintained throughout the codebase
